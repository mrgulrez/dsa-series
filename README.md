## Introduction

The Data Structures and Algorithms Series repository is a project initiated by @mrgulrez. The primary goal is to create a one-stop destination for learning and practicing data structures and algorithms. By providing code implementations in different programming languages, we aim to help developers of all levels grasp these fundamental concepts effectively.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow these simple steps:

1. **Cloning the repository:**

   git clone https://github.com/mrgulrez/dsa-series.git
   cd dsa-series


2. **Navigating to specific topics:**

Browse the folders to find the data structures or algorithms of your interest. Each folder contains code files, along with additional resources like explanations, time complexity analysis, and usage examples.

3. **Choosing a Programming Language:**

The repository supports multiple programming languages, so feel free to explore the code implementations in your preferred language.

4. **Testing and Running Code:**

Refer to the individual README files within each folder for instructions on how to compile and run the code.

## Contributing

We encourage and welcome contributions to the Data Structures and Algorithms Series. If you want to add new data structures, algorithms, improve existing code, or fix any issues, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository and create a new branch for your contribution.

2. Make your changes, ensuring to maintain code quality and consistency.

3. Add relevant tests and documentation where necessary.

4. Submit a pull request (PR) with a clear description of the changes you've made and the problem it solves.

5. Your PR will be reviewed, and feedback will be provided if required. Once approved, your changes will be merged into the main branch.
